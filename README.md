Sample application for Fastlane

### The PayPal JavaScript SDK

These examples use the [PayPal JavaScript SDK](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/) to display PayPal supported payment methods and provide a seamless checkout experience for your buyers.

The SDK has several [configuration options](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/configuration/) available. The examples in this repository provide the most minimal example possible to complete a successful transaction.

## Know before you code

### Setup a PayPal Account

To get started with standard checkout, you'll need a developer, personal, or business account.

[Sign Up](https://www.paypal.com/signin/client?flow=provisionUser) or [Log In](https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.paypal.com%252Fdeveloper%252Fapplications&intent=developer)

You'll then need to visit the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/) to obtain credentials and to
make sandbox accounts.

### Create an Application

Once you've setup a PayPal account, you'll need to obtain a **Client ID** and **Secret**. [Create a sandbox application](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox/create).

### Have Node.js installed

These examples will ask you to run commands like `npm install` and `npm start`.

You'll need a version of node >= 14 which can be downloaded from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
